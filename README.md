# Background

The Tableland project provides a zero-config Typescript/Javascript SDK that make it easy to interact with the Tableland network from Ethereum-based applications. The [`@tableland/sdk`](https://github.com/tablelandnetwork/js-tableland) SDK should feel comfortable to developers already familiar with the [`ethersjs` Javascript library](https://docs.ethers.io/). The Tableland SDK provides a small but powerful API surface that integrates nicely with existing ETH development best practices.

Simply import the library, connect to the Tableland network, and you are ready to start creating and updating tables.

# Install

Installation is easy using npm or yarn. An ES bundle is also available for those operating purely in a browser environnement.

```bash
npm i @tableland/sdk
```

> Note: Not seeing the build type you need for your project or idea? Let us know, we're happy to work with you to improve the SDK usability!

# Usage

Most common Tableland usage patterns will follow something like the following. In general, you'll need to connect, create, mutate, and query your tables. In that order :)

```typescript
import { connect } from "@tableland/sdk";

// Connect
const connection = await connect({ network: "testnet" });

// Create
await connection.create("id int primary key, val text");

// Write
const write = await connection.write(
  "INSERT INTO test_1 (colname) values (val1);"
);
console.log(write);
// {"hash": "blahhash"}

// Read
const query = await connection.read("SELECT * FROM test_1;");
console.log(query);
// {columns: [{name: "colname"}], rows: ["val1"]}
```
